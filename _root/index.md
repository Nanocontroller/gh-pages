> I'm a designer by training, and an egeneer by heart. My background as designer and my profesional experience as a researcher had lead me to very cool and exciting projects where design principles and research questions nicely meet. Wchich has eanganged me in very fun experimentation and learning procesess that allow me to explore with concepts such as Information Visuazliation, VR, AR, Human Computer Factors, Interaction Design and microcontrollers amongst many other cool tech. 

I love looking and playing with maps, because is a great way to see how humans make impact in naturally formed spaces.

"And the cool part is that most of that is to help people learn."

I put this site together to sample some of those projects/experimentations. Let me know if you are interested on learning more deatails about them.
